* Reading code under the influence of your emotions

Format: Talk, but there is a core of it that could be a short talk and a first message that could be a lightning.

Lots of material on *writing* "beautiful" code.
but nothing on *reading* "ugly" code!

Yet we spend most of our time reading do we not? And most code is "ugly" ?

Suffer less: arm yourself against the confusions, lies and outrages of legacy software.

Read that code with empathy. Evolve your reading by adopting different reading modes. Tool the reading.
