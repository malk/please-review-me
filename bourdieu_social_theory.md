# Bourdieu's social theory applied to tech

Every workplace, every community, and in fact every social interaction, is governed by various forces, hidden power structures, implicit oppression and submission. We oppress people by accident, and we are oppressed by others by accident.

Bourdieu's social theory (with concepts like “symbolic violence", “cultural capital” and “hexis”) explain what is happening. By understanding what he meant, we learn how each of us influences and is influenced by the people around us, in ways that we wouldn't expect.

This talk tries to make Bourdieu's ideas accessible. Learn how to improve your environment immediately; see why meritocracy is a dangerous lie; recognise oppression and submission when it happens; and gain the tools to fight it day to day.
