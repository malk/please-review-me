* Develop by — mostly — describing the problem

Format: Talk

Every test should describe the problem & not the solution, every program should do both.

Most of your current programs describe only the solution to a problem long forgot in time.

Let us change this, let us write programs that are  — mostly — a description of the problem.

Let us program by describing the results we seek instead of how to meet them.

Let us embrace the declarative style of logical/relational programming! But do so without switching our current language of our current legacy project.
