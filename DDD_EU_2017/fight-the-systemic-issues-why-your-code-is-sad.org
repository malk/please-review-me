* Fight the systemic issues why your code is sad

Format: workshop 1 day, tho I can make a 120 minutes hands-on with the first part of it

If you remake awful software from scratch without changing the culture that created it: you'll remake awful software.

Your legacy codebase is not only the fault of the devs: there is a whole system that is aouthor of that code.

In a hands-on always coding way: Let us explore that system, usually ignored, around your dev process.

And by seeing it: arm ourselves to fight it.
