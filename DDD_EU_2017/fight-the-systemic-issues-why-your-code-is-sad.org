* Fight the systemic issues why your code is sad

Try to create a code you will not consider “legacy”.

I’ll play the role of your client and use around 20 techniques to make
you fail.

You will fail.

We’ll then discuss what techniques I have used, how they happen in real
life, how to fight them in your project.

All languages welcome. Bring your own laptop with your
environment. We’ll split into small teams.
