* Understand accidental complexity, Hexagonal architecture & Out of the tar pit as a mob

Format: Workshop (1 or 2 days)

Dive into the Out of the tar pit paper. Understand Accidental & Essential complexity. Why they matter in design.
The cost in legacy creation of mixing them together today. An approach of separating them & using multi-paradigms to fight them.

Dive into hexagonal architecture see how well it marries with DDD and compare it to Out of the tar pit.

As a mob: work together into putting those ideas in practice.
