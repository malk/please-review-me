* Property-based testing (& domain invariants) for the rest of us

Format: Talk

Use Property-based tests on your legacy codebase! Reduce test-debt! Create smaller, fewer tests that: test more, are more readable & document the problem.

Domain invariants are all around you. In every business rule your domain expert ever tried to give you. You should be testing them! Not only an example representing
them: but testing the invariant itself.

You should also use these property based tests in an exploratory manner. Seeking to challenge your understanding of the domain
and communication with domain experts.
