* Domain invariants & property-based testing for the masses

Format: Talk

Domain invariants are all around you. In every business rule your domain
expert ever tried to give you. You should use them to guide your design.

You should also be testing them! Not only an example representing them:
but testing the invariant itself.

You can do them with property-based tests (PBTs),
and if you think you cannot do PBTs on legacy codebases
and/or outside functional programming this talk should show you otherwise.

Let's also use Property-based tests to reduce test-debt. Create smaller,
fewer tests that: test more, are more readable & document the
problem. Challenge your understanding of the domain and communication
with domain experts.
